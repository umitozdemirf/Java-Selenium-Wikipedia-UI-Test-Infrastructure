<h1>Explore Wikipedia Search Engine for Comprehensive Test
</h1>

**Target**: Possible bugs and improvements for Wikipedia Search Engine

**Resources**: Some resources, test data and UI Screen.

**Information**: It includes the measurement of the reliability, capability, and usability aspect of the system. Contains standard violations in design. It is recommended to examine the security, performance, or other aspects of the system.


<h3>Examples of Charters</h3>
* Explore editing profiles with injection attacks to discover security vulnerabilities

* Explore editing profiles with various login methods to discover surprises

* Explore input fields with JavaScript and SQL injection attacks to discover security vulnerabilities

* Explore catalog features with 10x # products to discover problems with browsing and searching

* Explore and analyze the product elements of . Produce a test coverage outline.

* Explore large pools of executors running at the same time to discover bad behavior related to race conditions or flaws in claiming runs of reasonably large values.

* Identify and test all claims in the  manual. (either use checkmark/X/? notation on the printed manual, or list each tested claim in your notes)

* Define work flows through Decide Right and try each one. The flows should represent realistic scenarios of use, and they should collectively encompass each primary function of the product.

* We need to understand the performance and reliability characteristics of DecideRight as decision complexity increased. Start with a nominal scenario and scale it up in terms of number of options and factors until the application appears to hang, crash, or gracefully prevent user from enlarging any further.

* Test all fields that allow data entry (you know the drill: function, stress, and limits, please)

* Analyze the file format of a DecideRight scenario and determine the behavior of the application when its elements are programmatically manipulated. Test for error handling and performance when coping with pathological scenario files.

* Check UI against Windows interface standards.

* Is there any way to corrupt a scenario file? How would we know itâ€™s corrupted? Investigate the feasibility of writing an automatic file checker. Find out if the developers have already done so.

* Test integration with external applications, especially Microsoft Word.

* Determine the decision analysis algorithm by experimentation and reproduce it in Excel. Then, use that spreadsheet to test DecideRight with complex decision scenarios.

* Run Decide Right under AppVerifier and report any errors.
